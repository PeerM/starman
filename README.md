The state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning
methods take hours or days to learn how to beat even the first
level of Super Mario Bros., but the best solutions for beating Super
Mario Bros. that human can find consist of mostly a few actions.
With this knowledge we hand made a biased random Agent that
beats the first level in 0.5% of the time. Random input beats the
level in fewer steps than the state of the art RL algorithm, but
once the RL agent is trained it is a lot more consistent.
